## üìñ Description
This data pack was originally planned as a part of a much bigger project which got paused due to mojang announcing to change how item data is stored in future versions. But since the work on this part was already done it would be just a waste to not make it available for download.

**Player Death Reworked** does exactly what it says - it overhauls some aspects of dying. Wether it's keeping just some of your inventory, losing some of your max health or getting a fancy new death message, it's all in here.

## ‚≠ê Features
- You only keep some of your inventory. In general it is stuff like armor, tools and operator items which will not drop upon death. Everything else does. 
- Death messages have been reworked to show one of 50 freshly made ones which will pay respect to our fallen brothers and sisters
- Get a message including the coordinates of your last death location and your current death counter after respawning
- Upon dying you lose 1 heart of your max health until you lost a maximum of 5 hearts. You can regain max health by eating enchanted golden apples or each morning.
- sleeping gives regeneration & saturation effects
- a new crafting recipe for enchanted golden apples
- subtle particles for dropped items
- player drops player head upon death

## üõ†Ô∏è How to
The datapack just needs to be dropped into your data packs folder of your world. There is nothing else you have to do. It just works out of the box.

If you plan on using it with some other mod or data pack which adds items than you would have to add them to the tag lists which are located in **\data\minecraft\tags\items**. There are two json files for droppable and non dropabble items.
